This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) in [PNPM](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) monorepo allowing front-end [React v18](https://github.com/facebook/react/) built on [MUIv5](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) styled components and back-end reuse of common package using [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) decorators messaging and other beauties.
